## 📂 Repository Structure

The project is divided by business category to handle specific regulatory and naming nuances:

* **`/beauty-personal-care`**: Logic for Skin Care, Hair Care, Makeup, and Fragrance.
* **`/vitamins-supplements`**: Logic for Health, Vitamins, and Dietary Supplements.

---

## ⚖️ Compliance & Constraints
* **Beauty**: Focus on sensory attributes and application areas.
* **Vitamins**: Strict adherence to non-medicinal claims; classification must not imply "cures" or "treatments" unless specified in the L4 logic.
